# connexAI-challenge

Thanks for reviewing my tech test, just a few points:

- You should be able to clone it and run the client and server individually to see the result in the browser:
    client - http://localhost:3000
    server - http://localhost:3000

- I kept to straight Javascript for this challenge
- I wrote some basic Jest tests, but was having endless errors with the jsdom test environment, something I missed perhaps with my create-react-app setup.

thanks again,
Miles
